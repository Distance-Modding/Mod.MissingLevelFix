# MissingLevelFix

This Distance Mod fixes the "Missing Level" bug, where the game is unable to download certain workshop levels.

This "bug" results in those levels not being available ingame and players getting sent back to a multiplayer lobby with the error text "Missing Level" when the host is loading one of those levels.
